# RGB, Y?
A classic top-down shooter game where the player has to switch between four different coloured characters to defeat enemies and puzzles.

## TODO
This will evolve constantly for the next few weeks, but here's a rough list of what I want to do next:
- [ ] Add a proper README
- [ ] Add a proper LICENSE
- [ ] Different projectiles for each character
- [ ] Add a simple enemy with a simple AI that tries to attack any of the player characters
- [ ] Enable collisions between projectiles and enemies so we can kill them
- [ ] Add simple floor switch that does an action - switches are activated when a character of the same colour stands on it
- [ ] Tiled map editor integration
- [ ] Player characters need health, which should be displayed on the HUD
- [ ] Orthoganal camera that follows the player but cannot leave any player character outside of the screen - they need to stay together
- [x] Add a TODO list to the README :)
